<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, Barry Barida</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from Nigeria</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a chrome extension**
- the extension is suppose to save urls and also help easily grab a url from your chrome tab and save it for later use.
- each button has their function so, depending on what task you want, click the buttons.
- it's really easy and fun to use. simple but interactive design too.
- the delete all button only works when double clicked
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **javascript (JSON)**
